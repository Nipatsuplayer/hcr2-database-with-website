            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Effective date: 26 December 2025</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This site collects a minimal amount of information needed to operate: anonymous usage data for statistics, and optional user-submitted content (records and news). We do not sell personal data.</p>

            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Public submissions: player names, map/vehicle selections and distances, and optional country text. These are stored in the site database for review and display.</li>
                <li>Admin authentication uses Discord OAuth; only basic Discord info is stored in the session for access control (Discord id and username).</li>
                <li>Server logs: IP addresses are recorded for rate-limiting and spam prevention of public submissions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How we use your information</h2>
            <p>Submitted records are stored so admins can review and (if approved) publish them as world records. IP addresses are used only for rate-limiting and abuse prevention. Admin Discord IDs are used to determine administrative access.</p>

            <h2>Cookies and third-party services</h2>
            <p>We use standard session cookies to maintain authenticated admin sessions. Third-party services (for example, GitHub links or Discord OAuth) are used for convenience; please review those providers' privacy policies for details.</p>

            <h2>Data retention</h2>
            <p>Public submissions and published news are retained until an admin removes them. If you want data removed, contact the site administrator (see contact section).</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable measures to secure the database and server. However, no online service can guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>This site is not intended for children under 13. Do not submit personal information about minors.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have questions or would like data removed, contact: <a href="mailto:nipatsuplaying@gmail.com">nipatsuplaying@gmail.com</a></p>

            <p style="margin-top:16px; font-size:13px; color:#555;">This policy may be updated; the effective date above indicates the latest revision.</p>
